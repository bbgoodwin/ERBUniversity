      <h2 class=best>The Best University East of the Mississippi</h2> <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a little over 60 years, ERB University has built a reputation as a world-class institution that combines a broadly interdisciplinary,
        international education with one of the most vibrant research programs in the nation. ERB University is proud to be a “premier public university,”
        which means we challenge our students academically, not financially. The result is a truly unique, best-of-both-worlds college experience.
        Our academic culture resembles a first-rate private university — rigorous, collaborative and boldly innovative — while our campus culture exemplifies
        the best kind of public university experience: richly diverse students, active social life and deep engagement with the community. Our students,
        both undergraduate and graduate, work one-on-one with an exceptional faculty that includes Pulitzer Prize winners and groundbreaking scholars.
        They take advantage of special academic opportunities like combined degrees, foreign language study groups and an unparalleled international education
        program.</p>

            <h2 class=best>Our students are singularly ambitious, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world.</h2> <br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At many other universities, students abide by the unwritten rule that if a professor doesn’t show up after ten minutes, they get to go home.
              Here, students want to learn. They like (alright, love) late nights in the lab, whiteboard sessions in the dorm, and problem sets over pizza.
              There’s a tinge of obsessiveness that hangs around the campus, a proclivity for nerding out.
              After all, when a problem is interesting and your lab partners are your friends, how can you draw the line between work and play? At ERB, we don’t.</p>
